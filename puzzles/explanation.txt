How numbers are decoded
1, 4, 7 and 8 have unique lengths
1 = 2 (0)
4 = 4 (2)
7 = 3 (1)
8 = 7 (8)
Therefor we immediatly known what numbers they belong to

By using the number 8 we can find all numbers
First we find the difference between 8 and the unknowns

Step 1
2, 3 and 5
2 shares 2 letters with 4
3 shares 3 letters with 4
5 shares 3 letters with 4

0, 6 and 9
0 shares 3 letters with 4
6 shares 3 letters with 4
9 shares 4 letters with 4

Use 4 to find 2 and 9

Step 2
3 and 5
3 shares 2 letters with 1
5 shares 1 letters with 1

0 and 6
0 shares 2 letters with 1
6 shares 1 letters with 1

Use 1 to find 3, 5 and 0, 6
